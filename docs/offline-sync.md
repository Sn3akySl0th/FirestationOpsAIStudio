# Offline sync

FirestationOps is offline-first. Operational writes are saved locally first, then uploaded when cloud sync is available.

## Sync states

| Status | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| `LOCAL_ONLY` | Saved on device only; not queued for upload (draft inspections). |
| `PENDING_SYNC` | Queued for upload to Firebase. |
| `SYNCED` | Confirmed uploaded to Firestore/Storage. |
| `SYNC_FAILED` | Upload failed; retry on next sync. |
| `CONFLICT` | Local and cloud versions diverged; officer must choose which version to keep. |

Duplicate finalized inspections for the same apparatus and template within the template frequency window are also flagged as conflicts during upload.

## Conflict resolution

When a device uploads a changed deficiency or incident, sync compares three versions:

1. **Baseline** — the last version this device successfully synced.
2. **Local** — the pending change on this device.
3. **Remote** — the current cloud copy.

If local and remote both differ from baseline, the record is marked `CONFLICT` instead of overwriting the cloud copy. Officers review conflicts from the dashboard **Review conflicts** screen and choose **Keep this device** or **Keep cloud**.

- **Keep this device** restores `PENDING_SYNC` so the chosen local version can upload on the next sync.
- **Keep cloud** applies the remote version locally and marks it `SYNCED`.

Finalized inspections remain append-only and are not merged through this workflow.

## Write path

1. User action saves to SQLDelight immediately.
2. Finalized inspections, deficiencies, attachments, and incident records are marked `PENDING_SYNC`.
3. Draft inspections remain `LOCAL_ONLY` until submitted.
4. The dashboard shows a pending-sync count.

## Sync order

The Android sync worker downloads the department catalog first, then operational records, then uploads pending local changes:

**Download (cloud → device)**

1. Department catalog (department, stations, apparatus, templates, members)
2. Finalized inspections
3. Deficiencies
4. Incidents, command-log entries, unit assignments, and personnel assignments
5. Attachment metadata and photo files from Cloud Storage

**Upload (device → cloud)**

1. Attachments (files to Cloud Storage, metadata to Firestore)
2. Finalized inspections
3. Deficiencies
4. Incidents, command-log entries, unit assignments, and personnel assignments

Catalog download includes the department document, stations, apparatus, templates, and department member roster. Administrators can upload an initial catalog from **Department settings** when the cloud catalog is empty.

Records with local `PENDING_SYNC` status are not overwritten by cloud downloads. This prevents losing unsent field work when another device has older cloud data.

Record IDs are reused as Firestore document IDs for idempotent retries.

## Attachment uploads

Photos captured during inspections are copied into durable app storage (`sync_attachments/`) before being queued. Upload failures set `SYNC_FAILED` with `lastError` and `failedAt` so they are visible separately from never-attempted uploads.

- **Inspection screen:** use **Take Photo** (camera) or **Choose Photo** (gallery), then view per-photo sync status, upload progress, and **Retry** when failed.
- **Dashboard:** failed uploads appear in a dedicated banner and in the sync queue with parent inspection context and **Retry** / **Retry all** actions.
- **After capture:** when cloud sync is available, the app attempts an immediate upload in the background.

Storage uploads require deployed `firebase/storage.rules` (including department ID normalization for badge numbers 200–225). Deploy with:

```bash
npx -y firebase-tools@latest deploy --only storage
```

## Triggers

- **Manual:** Dashboard **Sync now** button
- **Foreground:** Initial sync after authentication when Firebase is configured
- **Background:** WorkManager periodic job every 15 minutes when network is available (Android only)
- **Desktop manual:** Dashboard **Sync now** runs sync in a background coroutine when desktop Firebase is configured

Desktop and web targets use `NoOpSyncCoordinator` unless Firebase is configured. The Windows desktop app supports Firebase when `firebase-desktop.json` (or `~/.firestationops/firebase.json`) is present.

## Platform notes

- Firebase SDK calls live in `app/shared/src/androidMain` (Android) and `app/shared/src/jvmMain` (desktop) behind `SyncCoordinator` and `AuthRepository` interfaces.
- Shared sync logic lives in `DepartmentSyncEngine` with platform-specific `CloudSyncClient` implementations.
- Without `google-services.json`, Android falls back to local simulated authentication.
- Without desktop Firebase config, Windows falls back to local simulated authentication.
